## Similarities Finder
## Aaron and Phil's ST project 

A program using symbol tables to help find matches in a set of data from a user's attribute preferences. The data set will consist of a set of items which have a few types of attributes and then each specific item will have a value of each type of attribute (for example the attribute type is size, and the value will be small medium or large). Hash maps will be used for attribute types which have a set number of options and trees will be used when they have a range of options.
